This is a Moq®️ fork, which allows to Mock classes, see the [Myna](https://github.com/Kuinox/Myna) repo for more information.

Why did I not used Moq®️ name in my package name ?  
Because it's a registered trademark by the owner of the library.

ChangeList: 

- Added [Myna](https://github.com/Kuinox/Myna) as a dependency.
- Changed CastleProxyFactory Mock instantiation to allow Mocking class thanks to [Myna](https://github.com/Kuinox/Myna). 
- Removed Moq®️ trademark and copyright material since the author actively make infringement claims: https://github.com/stakx/moq/commit/5668da21d2a0d7f0b1beabc0c07ffffd46a53d86
